					            <p>According to me, the best things in school life are not the chapters     <br> 
					            	taught by the teachers, they are the lessons taught by our own experiences.                                                            <br>
							The best friends forever made during school life may change with time.          <br>
							You get to experience new things at school.                                     <br>
							Giving nicknames and calling teachers with those names would be fun.            <br>
							Waiting for your birthday just to wear colorful dress and distribute            <br> 
							chocolates will happen only in school life.                                     <br>
							Planning your vacation 15 days before the vacation has started cause            <br>
							 you don't wish to miss even a single day.                                      <br>
							Giving a speech for the first time in life majority happens only at school.     <br>
							Calling your crush as your love of life happens only at school.                 <br>
							Enjoying life without mobile phones happens only in school life.                <br>
							You will never ever want to leave your school at the end.                       <br>
							You get a rare idea of many things of life in your school life.                 <br>
							This waxs a list of best things and best lessons learnt at school    <p>
